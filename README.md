[![Built with Gatsby, React, TypeScript, and Firebase](https://github.com/maxkagamine/kagamine.dev/blob/4ed2540eef34076504d1665f2c5a836cb3c1a646/screenshot-promo-image.png)](https://kagamine.dev)

## Features

- Built entirely in **React** and **TypeScript** and served as a static site from Google's global CDN thanks to **Gatsby** and **Firebase Hosting**

- **Localized blog** with Markdown posts written in both English & Japanese and a **Firebase Cloud Function** redirecting users to either site based on their browser language

- One-click **push notifications** triggered automatically using the RSS feed with **Firebase Cloud Messaging** eliminating (most of) the Web Push API hassle

- Smooth header scaling adapts to any screen size using linear interpolation instead of fixed breakpoints (try resizing your browser)

- Custom GraphQL resolvers add **last updated dates from the git log** and auto-detect cover images

- Share button on blog posts leveraging the Web Share API, with fallback dropdown menu for desktop

- Post-build shenanigans add 2.9 kb to every html file (right click view source ðŸ˜‰)
